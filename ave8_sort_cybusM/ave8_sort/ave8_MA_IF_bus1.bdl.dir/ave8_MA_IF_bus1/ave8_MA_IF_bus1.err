I_BT1921: License has been successfully obtained by FLEXlm.
I_BT2971: Delay value unit of functional unit library file (C:/Program Files (x86)/cyber/5.52/packages/asic_90.FLIB) is changed (Delay value was changed to 100 double).
 [Action] Review the specification unit in option or, functional unit library file.
I_BT2788: Adjusted the unit of delay value of BLIB file (C:/Program Files (x86)/cyber/5.52/packages/asic_90.BLIB) (made the delay value 100 times).
 [Action] The specification of delay value unit needs to be revisited.
I_BT2619: Synthesize in ASIC mode.
I_BT4146: All signals are synthesized as descending bit-order because all declared signals are of descending bit-order.
W_BT3305: Global signal 'current_burst_mode' is assigned but not referenced.
